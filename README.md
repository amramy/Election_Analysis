# Election Analysis

### Election-Audit Summary
 
I would like to take a moment to let the election commission know that the data analysis script used here could be applied to any election. We would need to make sure the Ballot ID, County, and Candidate columns stay the same or we could modify the script to accommodate different columns in an excel worksheet. We could also modify the script to find the candidate results from individual counties.
