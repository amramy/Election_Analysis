# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this analysis of the Election Results, we are looking for which counties were involved and how many voters were from each county. From those votes we will find which county had the most voters and most importantly who won the county election.

### Election-Audit Summary
 
I would like to take a moment to let the election commission know that the data analysis script used here could be applied to any election. We would need to make sure the Ballot ID, County, and Candidate columns stay the same or we could modify the script to accommodate different columns in an excel worksheet. We could also modify the script to find the candidate results from individual counties.
